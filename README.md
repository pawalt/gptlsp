assistant: To analyze the project in your current directory, you can use the `analyze` function. Here is an example of how to use it:

\```ts
const analysis = functions.analyze({ instruction: "Analyze the project in the current directory" });
\```

This will perform an analysis of the project in your current directory. The returned `analysis` object will contain the results of the analysis.
user: call it
assistant: calling function analyze
list_files({
"directory": "."
}): {"filepaths":["README.md","functions.go","go.mod","go.sum","howdy/","howdy/how.go","main.go","nesting.go","repl.go","test/","test/whaddup.go"]}
analyze({
"instruction": "Analyze the project in the current directory"
}): {"analysis":"The project in the current directory contains the following files and directories:\n\n- README.md\n- functions.go\n- go.mod\n- go.sum\n- Directory: howdy\n  - Inside 'howdy', there's a fi...
assistant: The project in the current directory contains the following files and directories:

- README.md
- functions.go
- go.mod
- go.sum
- Directory: howdy
    - Inside 'howdy', there's a file named how.go
- main.go
- nesting.go
- repl.go
- Directory: test
    - Inside 'test', there's a file named whaddup.go

Would you like me to read the content of any specific file?
user: yeah the go files
assistant: calling function analyze
list_files({

assistant: Here are the contents of the Go files in the current directory:

1. **functions.go**

This file contains several utility functions which are used to interact with the file system and time. It includes functions to get the current time, list files in a directory, and read specific files. The functions are designed to interface with OpenAI's chat models.

2. **howdy/how.go**

This file is empty except for the package declaration.

3. **main.go**

This file is the entry point for the program. It loads environment variables and runs the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).

4. **nesting.go**

This file contains the Analyze function which is used to analyze files in a project. It sends requests to OpenAI's chat models and processes the responses.

5. **repl.go**

This file contains the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) function which handles user input and model responses. It also executes function calls from the assistant.

6. **test/whaddup.go**

This file is empty except for the package declaration.

# Project Title

This project is a command-line tool written in Go. It interacts with the OpenAI API to perform file and text operations based on user input.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to leverage the power of OpenAI's GPT-3 model to assist with file and text operations, making these tasks more efficient and intuitive.

## OpenAI Functions

In this project, we use several OpenAI functions to perform common coding tasks. These functions are defined in `functions.go` file. We have functions for getting the current time, listing files in a specified directory, reading files at given paths, and writing to a file at a given path. These functions are called based on the responses generated by the GPT-3 model in response to user input. This allows us to leverage the power of machine learning to automate and simplify file and text operations.

## Technical Description

This application includes several key components:

1. `functions.go`: This file defines several functions for getting the current time, listing files in a specified directory, reading files at given paths, and writing to a file at a given path. It also includes a function for handling errors.

2. `main.go`: This is the main entry point for the application. It loads environment variables from a `.env` file, instantiates a client using the OpenAI API key, and then runs a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).

3. `nesting.go`: This file defines functions for analyzing and modifying files in a project. It uses the OpenAI GPT-3 model to generate responses based on user input.

4. `repl.go`: This file contains the logic for the REPL. It takes user input, sends it to the GPT-3 model, and outputs the model's response. It also executes the relevant function based on the model's response.

5. `go.mod` and `go.sum`: These are standard Go files that manage the project's dependencies. Dependencies include the `go-openai`, `go-lsp`, and `godotenv` packages.

## Usage

Run the application from the command line. Ensure that you have set the necessary environment variables in a `.env` file.

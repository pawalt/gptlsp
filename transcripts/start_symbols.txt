assistant: I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to directly implement new functions in a specific programming language or modify existing code files. However, I can provide an example of such a function in Go for educational purposes.

Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "go/ast"
        "go/parser"
        "go/token"
        "os"
)

func GetGoSymbols(filepath string) ([]string, error) {
        fset := token.NewFileSet()
        node, err := parser.ParseFile(fset, filepath, nil, parser.ParseComments)
        if err != nil {
                return nil, err
        }

        var symbols []string
        ast.Inspect(node, func(n ast.Node) bool {
                switch x := n.(type) {
                case *ast.Ident:
                        if x.Obj != nil && x.Obj.Kind == ast.Var {
                                symbols = append(symbols, x.Name)
                        }
                }
                return true
        })

        return symbols, nil
}

func main() {
        filepath := os.Args[1]
        symbols, err := GetGoSymbols(filepath)
        if err != nil {
                fmt.Println(err)
                return
        }

        fmt.Println("Symbols:", symbols)
}
```

This script gets a filepath as an argument, parses the Go file at that path, and prints out all the top-level variable symbols. In a real implementation, you'd likely want to handle more kinds of symbols (like functions), and you might want to organize them better.

Please note that you'll need to integrate this code into your existing system and handle the file paths and other input/output in a way that makes sense in your context.

user: ok thanks
assistant: You're welcome! If you have any other questions or need further help, feel free to ask. Happy coding!

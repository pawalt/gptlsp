assistant: As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to directly modify your files. However, I can provide you with a refactored version of your code based on your requirements.

Assuming your `Analyze` and `Modify` functions look something like this:

```go
func Analyze(instruction string, systemMessageContent string, functionMetadata []FunctionMetadata) {
    // some logic here
}

func Modify(instruction string, systemMessageContent string, functionMetadata []FunctionMetadata) {
    // some logic here
}
```

You can refactor it to include a new `ProcessRequest` function that encapsulates the common logic:

```go
func ProcessRequest(instruction string, systemMessageContent string, functionMetadata []FunctionMetadata) {
    // common logic here
}

func Analyze(instruction string, systemMessageContent string, functionMetadata []FunctionMetadata) {
    ProcessRequest(instruction, systemMessageContent, functionMetadata)
    // specific logic for Analyze
}

func Modify(instruction string, systemMessageContent string, functionMetadata []FunctionMetadata) {
    ProcessRequest(instruction, systemMessageContent, functionMetadata)
    // specific logic for Modify
}
```

In this refactored code, the `ProcessRequest` function contains the common logic that was originally duplicated in the `Analyze` and `Modify` functions. Now, these functions call `ProcessRequest` and then perform any logic that is specific to them.

Please replace the comment lines with your actual code logic. If you provide the actual code of `Analyze` and `Modify` functions, I can help you in a more accurate way.
